# How is Bob Hosted?
> **Note**
This is subject to change as the usage of Bob has begun to push the limits of a Raspberry Pi 4. Bob will probably be migrated to Azure.

Bob runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS Lite. This enables a lot of freedom in terms of feature sets because Bob no longer relies on [replit](replit.com). Replit was originally used, but after an outrageous price increase it was no longer viable.
