# Features

### ❤️ Make your server feel closer!
Bob *loves* to make people feel connected with tons of friendly features such as `/hug`, `/hi`, `/poll`, and **more**. Plus if you want to spice things up you can use `/ship` to determine how good of a match people could make (according to the universe), or if you are *too shy* to tell someone how you really feel you can use `/confess` to have Bob send DM with your handwritten message!

### 🖊️ The best quote system!
Making memories is important and with `/quote new` you can do just that! Bob will *automatically* format the message, *and* dynamically let you know how long ago a quote was made. On top of that, you can add tags for searching through specific types of quotes.

### ✨ Stand out!
Use `/fonts`, to transform your text into something that is *guaranteed* to grab users' attention., or use `/encrypt` to secure your message.

### 🎮 Play games!
With multiple games to choose from like `/connect4`, `/tic-tac-toe`, `/trivia`, `/mastermind`, `/rock-paper-scissors` and *only more* on the way, Bob is ready to keep provide your server with the entertainment it *needs* to thrive.

### 🖨️ Automatically do things!
With commands like `/auto preview-messages` and `/auto preview-github` you can see the contents of a message, code file, pull request, or issue without ever leaving the channel they were shared in. Plus, you don't need to worry about publishing messages in news channels with `/auto publish-announcements`.

### 🎲 All the RNG!
Bob has a ***plethora*** of random commands to either fuel your Dungeons and Dragons experience like `/random dice-roll`, or simply cure your boredom with `/random 8ball`, `/random dad-joke`, `/random fact`, and many more!

### 🤖 Easily confused? no worries!
Bob has many features *built in* to ensure that you never get stuck. Give an invalid input to a command? *Fear not* as Bob will let you know, and inform you about valid inputs.

# How is Bob Hosted?
Bob currently lives on railway after migrating from a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS Lite (learn more from [this blog](https://bobthebot.net/blogs/we-are-migrating-to-railway.html)). Replit was originally used, but after an outrageous price increase it was no longer viable and the Raspberry Pi 4 went into use.
